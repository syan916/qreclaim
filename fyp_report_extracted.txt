Qreclaim Abstract 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 4 
Abstract 
This project, Qreclaim: Smart Lost-and-Found System with AI-Powered Image and RFID Verification, 
was developed to address long-standing weaknesses in the lost-and-found process at TAR UMT Johor. 
The existing practice relies on informal channels such as WhatsApp and Facebook, which leads to poor 
accountability, inconsistent item recovery, and weak verification of ownership. The purpose of this 
project is to design a structured and secure platform that improves the way lost items are reported, 
matched, and claimed, ensuring greate r efficiency and trust in the process. The scope of the system 
covers four main modules: a centralized reporting platform for both students and staff, an AI-powered 
image tagging and similarity matching engine using BLIP and CLIP models, a dual -factor clai m 
verification process combining RFID student ID cards and facial recognition through a prototype kiosk, 
and an administrator dashboard with locker management and analytics. The project adopts the 
Incremental Model as its methodology, with system developme nt supported by Firebase, Python, 
Hugging Face models, and Raspberry Pi integration. Requirements were gathered through research, 
surveys, and observation, leading to a structured Software Requirements Specification and detailed 
system design. Testing in this phase focused on functional correctness and usability feedback, ensuring 
that core modules performed as expected. Results showed that the system design successfully addressed 
the main problems identified, offering secure verification, improved item matching, and a user-friendly 
interface. However, limitations remain in scalability and mobile app support. Overall, this Project I 
report concludes that integrating AI, IoT, and usability principles provides a feasible and effective 
solution to campus lost-and-found challenges, and the outcomes of this stage lay a clear foundation for 
implementation and evaluation in Project II.

1 Introduction 
This chapter introduces the Final Year Project titled “Qreclaim: Smart Lost-and-Found System 
with AI-Powered Image and RFID Verification.” It explains the motivation for the project, its 
background, goals, unique contributions, technical plan, and project team. The system is designed 
to improve the current lost-and-found process at TAR UMT Johor Branch, which suffers from poor 
structure, inefficient item recovery, and unreliable identity verification. The chapter also defines 
the scope of the project clearly: it includes the development of a centralized web platform for 
reporting and matching items, AI-based image recognition for automatic tagging, and a self-service 
prototype with facial recognition and RFID technology for claim verifi cation. The system also 
includes an administrative dashboard for decision -making regarding long -unclaimed items. 
However, this project will not cover mobile app development, full campus deployment, or social 
media integration. The main focus is to develop a working prototype and system to support lost -
and-found activities within the Johor campus. 
1.1 Background 
TAR UMT Johor currently does not have an official or centralized system to handle lost-and-found 
cases. Instead, students and staff rely on community -driven social media platforms such as 
WhatsApp, Facebook, and Xiaohongshu groups to report or search for lost items. These channels 
are informal and unregulated, resulting in a lack of proper tracking, inconsistent item recovery, 
and poor accountability. Without an official system, it is difficult to trace ownership or know 
whether an item has been recovered or not. This lack of structure leads to confusion and prevents 
the university from managing these cases efficiently (OnlyTARCianKnow, n.d.; TAR UMT, n.d.; 
Shivaramakrishnaan & Logesh, 2025; Umo, 2023). 
 
Another major problem is the absence of any intelligent or automated method to match lost items 
with those that have been found. Currently, staff must rely on memory or manually compare vague 
descriptions and photos to identify possible matches. This proce ss is time -consuming and often 
inaccurate. Many lost items are never recovered simply because their descriptions are too general, 
or because no proper search or filtering mechanism exists. AI-driven systems such as LostNet and 
other deep learning models have demonstrated that intelligent visual recognition can significantly 
improve item recovery processes through accurate tagging and similarity matching (Zhou et al., 
2024; Ghazal et al., 2016). 
 
In addition, there is no secure way to verify whether someone claiming an item is the rightful 
owner. At present, items are usually returned based on verbal confirmation or guesses, which can 

--- PAGE 10 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 1 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 9 
be easily manipulated. This weak verification process increases the risk of false claims, 
impersonation, and theft. It also creates mistrust in the system. Research shows that institutions 
like Rutgers University implement strict identification processes t o prevent such issues, while 
others propose biometric and RFID-based verification to enhance security (Shivaramakrishnaan & 
Logesh, 2025; Rutgers University, n.d.). 
 
Lastly, there is no structured review of the system’s usability or how well it works for students and 
administrators. Items that are not claimed over time are left in storage or discarded without proper 
review. The current process lacks tools for monitoring, analysis, or decision-making. This makes 
the system inefficient and unsustainable in the long term, especially as more items continue to be 
lost without a proper follow -up. Studies have shown that systems with poor usability tend to be 
abandoned by users, highlighting the importance of applying human -computer interaction (HCI) 
principles (Bringula & Basa, 2011). 
1.2 Project Objectives 
This project focuses on solving the four major weaknesses in TAR UMT Johor Branch’s current 
lost-and-found system. These include the absence of a centralized platform, no intelligent way to 
match lost and found items, unreliable methods of verifying the id entity of claimants, and the 
lack of a structured review process for unclaimed items or system usability. The goal of this 
project is to design and implement a smart web -based platform that integrates artificial 
intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and secure verification technologies to improve how 
lost items are reported, matched, claimed, and managed across campus. Each of the following 
objectives is linked directly to one of the problems identified and is supported by a related 
research question. 
1.2.1 To develop a centralized lost-and-found platform for structured and 
official item reporting 
The first objective of this project is to design a single, centralized web platform that allows both 
students and administrative staff to submit, search, and manage lost -and-found item reports. 
Currently, TAR UMT Johor relies on informal channels such as W hatsApp, Facebook, and 
Xiaohongshu for this process, which leads to inconsistent tracking, data loss, and poor 
accountability. The proposed system will offer an organized digital form to report found or lost 
items, complete with item descriptions, location, timestamp, and image uploads. This data will 
be securely stored and managed in a Firebase cloud database. The system also supports real -
time notifications and structured access roles for students and administrators (Google Cloud, 
2023). 

--- PAGE 11 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 1 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 10 
 
This objective directly addresses the lack of a centralized and official system and improves the 
university’s ability to trace lost items, manage inventory, and maintain proper records. It 
provides a reliable structure for reporting that social media tools  simply cannot offer. The 
corresponding research question is: "How can a centralized web application improve the 
consistency and efficiency of the campus lost-and-found process?" 
1.2.2 To apply AI -powered image recognition for automatic item tagging and 
accurate matching using Hugging Face Bootstrapping Language-Image 
Pre-training (BLIP) Model 
The second objective is to use artificial intelligence to improve how lost and found items are 
categorized and matched within the system. Currently, there is no intelligent way to match items, 
and staff rely on manual comparisons and vague descriptions. Th is process is inefficient, 
especially when items look similar or have generic features like “black wallet” or “red water 
bottle.” To solve this, the system will integrate the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-
training) model developed by Salesforce and made available through Hugging Face. BLIP is a 
pre-trained vision–language model that can generate context -aware captions from uploaded 
images, which can then be transformed into structured hashtags for item tagging. 
In this project, BLIP will not be developed from scratch, but  adopted in two possible 
deployment approaches: either by accessing the Hugging Face Inference API for real -time 
captioning, or by downloading and running the BLIP model locally on a backend server through 
the Hugging Face Transformers library. Both methods ensure that the system can leverage state-
of-the-art image captioning without requiring model training by the researcher. The generated 
tags will be used to compare new lost item reports with existing found item records using 
similarity scoring technique s. When the system identifies a high -probability match, it will 
notify the student for further action (Zhou et al., 2024; Ghazal et al., 2016). 
This integration reduces the time spent on manual checking and significantly improves 
matching accuracy, especially when descriptions are unclear or incomplete. By reusing an 
advanced AI model within the system’s design, the project demonstrates how existing research 
outputs can be effectively applied in practical applications. The research question related to this 
objective is: “How can AI image recognition improve the accuracy and speed of item matching 
in a campus lost-and-found system?”

Qreclaim Chapter 1 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 11 
1.2.3 To implement secure item claim verification using multi-factor 
authentication with RFID and facial recognition 
The third objective is to make the claiming process more secure and trustworthy by requiring 
users to go through a two-step identity verification before they can retrieve a found item. In the 
current system, items are returned based on verbal descriptions or guesses, which can easily be 
faked or misused. This project will introduce a secure claim kiosk built with a Raspberry Pi, an 
RFID card reader, and a USB camera. Students must first complete a facial recognition check 
using a model hosted through Huggin g Face, which generates a temporary QR code. At the 
kiosk, the students must present this QR code and scan their RFID student card. Only when 
both forms of identity are verified will the system allow the claim to proceed (Suárez-Armas & 
Caballero-Gil, 2017; Ismail et al., 2025). 
This dual-verification system reduces the chances of impersonation or accidental item release 
and increases the reliability of the lost -and-found process. It ensures that the student claiming 
the item is the rightful owner and that all actions are logged s ecurely. The related research 
question is: "In what ways can combining facial recognition and RFID technology improve the 
security and reliability of item claims?". 
1.2.4 To evaluate the usability of the lost-and-found system through surveys 
The fourth objective of this project is to ensure that the system is user-friendly, accessible, and 
easy to navigate for both students and administrators. While the main goal is to improve lost -
and-found management, it is equally important that users can i nteract with the system 
confidently and without confusion. In the current process, there is no formal evaluation of how 
easy or effective the lost-and-found system is. Students are not guided properly, and staff have 
no tools to monitor how well the system  is being used. Poor usability can lead to frustration, 
abandonment, and even system failure, regardless of how well the technical features work. 
 
To solve this, the proposed system will follow Human -Computer Interaction (HCI) principles 
in its interface design. Guidelines such as Nielsen’s usability heuristics and the Malaysia 
Government Design System (MYDS) will be used to design clear layouts, pro vide proper 
feedback messages, and reduce user errors (Nielsen, 2024; Malaysia Digital, 2024). Rounded 
buttons, simple icons, and step -by-step forms will be included to help users understand and 
complete their tasks easily. In addition, usability testing will be conducted with real users during 
development. Students and admins will provide feedback on the interface, and their responses 
will be used to improve the design iteratively (Moran, 2019; Bringula & Basa, 2011).

BMCS3403 Project I 12 
This objective ensures that the system is not only functional but also comfortable and satisfying 
to use, especially in a university environment where users may have different levels of digital 
experience. The corresponding research question is: "How can u ser-centered design and HCI 
evaluation improve the usability and acceptance of a smart campus lost-and-found system?"

1.3 Advantages and Contributions 
The Qreclaim system offers major improvements over the traditional lost -and-found processes 
currently used at TAR UMT Johor Branch and many other institutions. Unlike manual methods 
or basic Google Forms shared on social media, Qreclaim introduces a smart, centralized , and 
secure platform for managing lost and found items. The following are the core advantages and 
contributions of the system: 
1.3.1 Centralized Platform for Consistent Reporting and Accountability 
Presently, students and staff resort to social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and 
Xiaohongshu to report lost items. This approach is prone to missing information, duplicate 
entries, and no formal supervision. In contrast, Qreclaim offers a struct ured web platform 
powered by Firebase. Every report  including photos, descriptions, timestamps, and status 
updates are securely logged in one unified system. Both administrators and students access 
dashboard views customized to their roles, enabling accurate tracking, reliable updates, and 
real-time synchronization. This eliminates data loss, confusing duplicates, and manual errors in 
logs, ensuring full accountability. 
Academically, this platform demonstrates how cloud -based database systems can enhance 
operational workflows in university contexts. The design reflects proven benefits such as 
improved data integrity, access control, and administration transparency (Shakil, Sethi & Alam, 
2015). Practically, Qreclaim offers a scalable, cost-effective template that other institutions can 
adopt to formalize their own inventory or lost -and-found systems, replacing informal 
procedures with a dependable, centralized model. 
1.3.2 AI-Powered Image Tagging and Matching for Efficient Recovery 
Using only textual descriptions to match lost and found items is inefficient and often fails when 
descriptions are vague (“black wallet,” “red bottle”). Qreclaim solves this by leveraging the 
BLIP model to automatically extract image tags that describe vis ual features such as color, 
texture, shape, or object type. These tags feed into a similarity‑scoring algorithm that rapidly 
identifies probable matches between reported lost and found items. This speeds up recovery, 
reduces manual workload, and minimizes errors all without relying on human interpretation. 
This solution advances research on vision -language models like BLIP by applying them in a 
real-world campus scenario. It builds on systems such as LostNet, which achieved high 
accuracy (96.8%) in matching lost objects based on image similarity (Zhou et al. , 2023). 
Qreclaim demonstrates that AI-based visual tagging can be effectively deployed within a live 
environment to automate previous labor-intensive processes, making the system proactive and 
responsive.

Qreclaim Chapter 1 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 14 
1.3.3 Secure Dual-Factor Verification to Prevent False Claims 
Traditional claim processes often lack verification and can result in items being taken by 
unauthorised individuals. Qreclaim addresses this through a dual -factor authentication kiosk: 
claimants must scan their RFID student card and pass facial recognition verification before the 
system releases an item. Each claim is logged with time, user identity, and confirmation status, 
increasing trust and preventing impersonation or fraudulent retrieval. 
This project exemplifies practical integration of IoT and biometric authentication in a campus 
setting. Studies show that combining RFID scans and facial recognition provides stronger 
security than single-factor systems (Yadav et al., 2019). Qreclaim offers real-world insight into 
deploying these technologies safely and efficiently, particularly for institutional use, and 
supports research into robust, accessible authentication methods. 
 
1.3.4 Human-Centered Usability Design for Better Adoption and Accessibility 
Even advanced systems fail if real users find them difficult to navigate. Qreclaim prioritizes 
usability by following established HCI principles (e.g. Nielsen’s heuristics) and the Malaysia 
Government Design System (MYDS). The interface includes clear icon s, step-by-step forms, 
contextual feedback, and accessible visual elements. Usability testing with students and staff is 
embedded in the development cycle, with iterations made based on actual user feedback. This 
human-centered approach ensures the system is intuitive and reduces errors. 
By integrating iterative user studies and HCI best practices into system design, Qreclaim 
contributes to the body of usability research  especially in the Malaysian higher -education 
context, where such evaluations are sparse. It provides empirical evidence that user -centered 
design leads to higher adoption rates, fewer errors, and greater satisfaction. It serves as a viable 
model for future systems prioritising accessibility and real-world usability. 
1.4 Project Plan 
The project is divided into two main phases: Project I and Project II, with clearly defined goals 
and deliverables in each stage. 
 
During Project I, the focus is on research, problem analysis, and system planning. This includes 
identifying the main problems in TAR UMT’s current lost-and-found process, reviewing existing 
academic solutions, and deciding on the key technologies to be us ed. Functional requirements 
are collected, and early design work is completed, such as creating case diagrams, system 
architecture, wireframes, and the project proposal documentation.

Qreclaim Chapter 1 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 15 
In Project II, the development of the actual system begins. The web-based platform is built using 
Firebase for backend data storage and Python for AI integration. The Raspberry Pi -based 
prototype is implemented to handle identity verification through RFID card scanning and facial 
recognition. Once the system modules are completed, the project enters the testing phase, which 
includes functional testing, integration testing, and usability testing involving real students and 
admin users. Their feedback will be  used to improve the user interface and fix any technical 
issues. 
 
This project plan ensures that the system can be developed within the academic schedule while 
meeting all functional, security, and usability goals.

1.6 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
This chapter has provided an overview of the Qreclaim project, highlighting its motivation, 
background, objectives, contributions, and implementation plan. The chapter began by 
establishing the need for a structured and intelligent lost-and-found solution at TAR UMT Johor 
Branch, noting the limitations of the current reliance on informal social media platforms and 
manual processes. The background section emphasized four key issues that currently affect item 
recovery on campus: the absence of a centralized reporting platform, the lack of intelligent item 
matching, weak verification procedures, and the absence of usability evaluation or structured 
handling of unclaimed items. These challenges served as the foundation for the formulation of 
the project objectives.

The project objectives were then defined in detail, aligning each objective with one of the 
identified problems. These include developing a centralized web platform for reporting lost and 
found items, implementing AI -based image recognition for automatic t agging and similarity 
matching, integrating a dual-factor claim verification system using RFID and facial recognition, 
and improving system usability through user -centered design and iterative evaluation. The 
chapter also described the unique contributions of Qreclaim, emphasizing how it combines cloud 
technology, artificial intelligence, and IoT to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly system. 
 
Furthermore, the project plan and milestone schedule were outlined to ensure that the project is 
completed in a structured and timely manner. Project I focuses on research, analysis, and design, 
while Project II emphasizes system development, integration, and usability testing. Finally, the 
project team and organization section clarified the roles and responsibilities of the student 
developer and supervisor, ensuring accountability throughout the project. 
 
In evaluating this chapter, it successfully establishes the importance and relevance of the project 
by connecting the identified problems with practical and research-based solutions. The objectives 
are well-defined, measurable, and logically aligned with the issues highlighted in the background 
section. The chapter also demonstrates a clear technical and methodological direction, ensuring 
that the project is feasible within the allocated timeframe. Overall, Chapter 1 sets a strong 
foundation for the subsequent chapters by defining the problem space, justifying the need for the 
system, and presenting a clear roadmap for its development and evaluation

2 Literature Review 
This chapter presents a detailed review of relevant literature related to the development of 
Qreclaim, a Smart Lost and Found System designed for the TAR UMT campus. It includes a study 
of the current problems in the existing campus lost and found process,  such as lack of proper 
tracking, manual matching, and unreliable claim verification. In addition, this chapter explores 
existing systems implemented by other institutions to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. By 
understanding the limitations of cur rent practices and reviewing similar systems, this literature 
review helps justify the need for Qreclaim and supports the design decisions made during system 
development. 
2.1 Similar System Study 
This section reviews existing lost and found systems implemented by other universities in Malaysia, 
identifying their key features, benefits, and limitations. These examples provide insight into current 
practices and help establish a foundation for the design of Qreclaim. 
 
A comparative analysis was conducted to explore existing lost and found systems implemented in 
Malaysian university environments. This study focuses on four relevant examples: the FoundeLost 
system from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), an RFID -based p rototype developed at 
UiTM Arau, a faculty-level portal from Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), and the e-Aduan 
module from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). Each system is analyzed in terms of 
key features, benefits, and limitations, with the objective of identifying gaps that Qreclaim aims to 
address through enhanced functionality and user experience. 
 
2.1.1 FoundeLost (UKM) 
One of the most structured university -level lost and found systems is FoundeLost, developed by 
students at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). It is a web and Android -based platform that 
allows users to register using their matriculation number and post listings for lost or found items. 
Each item listing includes a title, image, category, and description, and users can manage 
submissions through a personal dashboard. The system is also programmed to automatically delete 
any listing that exceeds 30 days, w hich helps maintain listing relevancy and prevents database 
clutter (Tan & Chong, 2023). 
 
As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the FoundeLost system flow begins with user login, followed by 
manual item submission or search navigation. Users are expected to browse the entire listing 

--- PAGE 22 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 21 
library, visually identify potential matches, and initiate contact or claims based on descriptive 
alignment. All verification is handled manually, which places significant responsibility on the user 
to ensure accuracy. This traditional flow lacks backend i ntelligence or security layers, relying 
instead on human effort and memory. 
 
The key advantage of FoundeLost is that it creates a centralized platform within the university 
environment, reducing the reliance on social media groups or physical bulletin boards. It also 
provides users with direct access to reports and claims status in  real-time. However, the system 
still depends entirely on manual navigation by users. There is no intelligent search or matching 
capability built into the system, so students must scroll through all available entries to find possible 
matches. In addition, there is no integrated verification mechanism beyond manual description 
matching, which could lead to false claims or mistaken identity. These weaknesses limit its 
scalability and security in larger institutions. 
 
Qreclaim addresses these limitations by incorporating AI-based image-text similarity search using 
deep learning models such as BLIP or CLIP. Rather than requiring students to browse listings, the 
system can suggest potential matches based on uploaded images or tex tual clues. Additionally, 
Qreclaim includes RFID card scanning and facial recognition for claim verification, ensuring that 
the process is more accurate and secure for both students and campus staff.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 22 
 
2.1.2 RFID-Based System (UiTM Arau) 
Another solution was introduced by Ilias et al. (2020) from UiTM Arau, who developed a web -
based prototype tailored specifically for their university’s lost and found operations. The system 
utilized RFID technology to help identify owners of misplaced item s, and automated email 
notifications were sent to the rightful owners once a tagged item was scanned by staff. A reporting 
and tracking portal were also provided, allowing users to submit and view lost or found item 
records, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. 
 
The system included enforced user login, featuring dedicated interfaces for both students and 
administrators (Figure 2.3). Additionally, only the original poster was permitted to edit or delete 
their submitted reports, which helped maintain accountability and prevent unauthorized 
modifications. For its intended scope within UiTM Arau, the system offered a practical and 
functional solution to improve lost and found management through basic digitalization and RFID-
based identification. 
 
Nevertheless, the prototype was limited to a single university context and lacked certain advanced 
features that would improve scalability and security, such as biometric verification or broader 
device accessibility. Qreclaim addresses these gaps by offeri ng a mobile -responsive design 
suitable for both desktop and smartphones, and by integrating RFID with facial recognition to 
enable more secure and verifiable claim processes. This multi -layered approach enhances both 
usability and reliability, especially in larger campus environments like TAR UMT Johor.

2.1.3 Faculty Portal (UNIMAS FCSIT) 
UNIMAS implemented a simple faculty-level lost and found portal within its Faculty of Computer 
Science and Information Technology (FCSIT) (Sadiah & Nyambong, 2020). The system allowed 
staff and students to post lost or found items using a form -based web interface, which was then 
made available on a shared online bulletin board for others to browse. The portal served as a digital 
replacement for traditional notice boards and simplified communication within the faculty. 
 
While this system increased visibility for lost items within FCSIT, it was never scaled to support 
the entire university. The scope was limited to a single faculty, and the lack of AI search, feedback 
features, or claim verification protocols meant that th e system relied heavily on manual effort. 
There was also no mechanism for ensuring only authorized users could submit or manage listings. 
 
Qreclaim addresses these shortcomings by supporting a campus -wide user base and offering 
advanced AI -powered item search based on both image and text inputs. Its Firebase backend 
enables real-time synchronization across multiple departments, and administrative features ensure 
that only verified users can manage entries. 
 
2.1.4 e-Aduan Lost & Found (UTeM) 
At Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), the e-Aduan module was designed as part of a 
broader complaint and request system for campus users. Among its functions, it enabled students 
to submit details about lost or found items online, receive claim st atus updates, and set pickup 
appointments for recovered belongings. The system was web -based and utilized Oracle and PHP 
technologies (Shamshur & Nabilah, 2016). 
 
Figure 2.4 shows the navigation design chart of the e -Aduan platform, outlining how the web 
interface communicates with the Oracle back -end to manage item reports and user submissions. 
The framework reflects a traditional client-server model, where all verification and validation tasks 
are conducted manually by administrative staff. 
 
Despite its functionality, e -Aduan was built more as a passive reporting tool than an intelligent 
matching system. As shown in Figure 2.5, the lost item report form was limited to manual text 
inputs without any support for image uploads or automated classi fication. The system did not 
leverage machine learning, image recognition, or tagging features, meaning the entire process of 
claim validation relied on human comparison by staff. It also lacked mobile responsiveness, 
limiting accessibility for students who primarily use smartphones. 

--- PAGE 26 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 25 
 
In contrast, Qreclaim  enhances this concept by introducing image upload capabilities and 
automatic tag generation using AI-based object detection and captioning. These features allow the 
system to semantically match reported and found items more accurately without full relianc e on 
manual inputs. Combined with a mobile -friendly interface and integrated biometric and RFID 
verification, Qreclaim offers a more intelligent, secure, and user-centric solution for managing lost 
and found processes in modern university environments.

2.2 Project Background 
In recent years, university campuses such as TAR UMT Johor have encountered growing 
challenges in managing lost and found operations due to the absence of a centralized digital system. 
Currently, students and staff rely on fragmented communication tools su ch as WhatsApp, 
Telegram, and Facebook groups to report and search for lost items. These informal platforms are 
not designed for structured item tracking and often result in missed connections between lost and 
found reports. Consequently, many items remain unclaimed, leading to frustration among students 
and additional burden for administrative staff responsible for storing and verifying items. 
 
In response to address these issues, the proposed system Qreclaim introduces a structured, AI -
powered platform that streamlines the entire lost and found process through the integration of 
image recognition, RFID verification, and real time data synchroniz ation. This system aims not 
only to enhance the efficiency of item recovery but also to reduce false claims and ensure greater 
transparency throughout the item's lifecycle. This section highlights the major limitations of TAR 
UMT’s current system and presents the specific solutions that Qreclaim offers to overcome them.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 27 
2.2.1 Limitations of Current Systems 
 
Lack of a Centralized and Structured Reporting Platform 
Currently, the lost and found process at TAR UMT Johor campus lacks a centralized platform 
for managing item reports. Students who lose belongings often turn to informal channels such 
as WhatsApp, Telegram, or WeChat groups to post about missing items (Figure 2.6). However, 
these communication methods are disorganized and difficult to track. Since different faculties 
or departments may operate their own separate groups, the process becomes fragmented and 
inconsistent. 
 
This disconnection results in redundancy and wastes time, as students may post on multiple 
social media platforms or visit various offices without knowing whether an item has already 
been recovered elsewhere. This becomes particularly frustrating in urgent  cases involving 
important items like student ID cards, wallets, or laptops. The reliance on unstructured 
platforms such as the “OnlyTARCianKnow Lost and Found” Facebook group illustrates this 
problem while it helps publicize lost items, it lacks systemati c categorization or verification, 
which reduces the chances of successful recovery (OnlyTARCianKnow, n.d.). 
 
This weakness is similarly observed in other institutions such as UMP and UTeM, where item 
reporting is also conducted through general-purpose digital forms or community posts that do 
not provide centralized oversight. These systems, although digital, do not unify records across 
departments, resulting in siloed data and ineffective searches. 
 
In the role t o overcome this limitation, Qreclaim introduces a centralized web -based system 
that allows students and staff to submit, view, and manage lost and found records within a single 
digital platform. With real -time data synchronization, all records become acces sible to 
authorized users, enabling consistent and traceable item management. This centralized 
approach eliminates communication gaps and promotes a more efficient and transparent 
recovery process. 
 
  

--- PAGE 29 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 28 
No Structured Method to Categorize or Match Lost and Found Items 
The current manual approach to handling lost and found items lacks a structured method for 
categorizing or matching records. Found items are often described vaguely, while lost item 
reports from students use inconsistent terminology. Without standardized t ags or automated 
similarity detection, staff must rely on subjective visual inspection to attempt a match an  
inefficient and error-prone process. 
 
This issue becomes more problematic when handling commonly lost items like USB drives, 
water bottles, or stationery. For example, if a student reports losing a "blue thumb drive," but 
the item is recorded as a "small black storage device," it becomes difficult to determine whether 
they refer to the same object. The inconsistency in item descriptions, along with the absence of 
photos or structured metadata, significantly reduces retrieval accuracy. Ghazal et al. (2016) 
emphasize that multi-feature image matching and structured metadata greatly improve object 
retrieval accuracy in digital systems. 
 
Other universities, such as UMP and UTHM, also show this shortcoming, as their systems 
depend largely on user -written descriptions without any enforced categorization or AI -driven 
support. The absence of intelligent suggestion or tagging functions leads to  inconsistencies, 
making it harder for staff to efficiently match found items with lost reports. 
 
Qreclaim addresses this limitation by enforcing standardized metadata input during item 
submission, including fields for item type, color, brand, and optional photo uploads. 
Additionally, it leverages AI-based image-text similarity models to analyze visual and textual 
attributes, enhancing the system's ability to match lost and found reports. The combination of 
structured data and intelligent matching significantly improves item recovery accuracy.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 29 
Weak and Unreliable Claim Verification Process 
In the current campus lost-and-found system, item claim verification relies primarily on manual 
checks and verbal descriptions provided by students. Staff typically assess ownership based on 
general item details or student assertions, such as claiming a “b lack umbrella” or a “generic 
charger.” This method is highly subjective and poses a significant risk of misidentifying the 
rightful owner, especially when items lack unique identifiers. As a result, items may be released 
to the wrong person, which can unde rmine trust in the system and create conflicts between 
students and administrators. 
 
This weak verification process becomes even more problematic for high -value items, such as 
personal electronics or branded accessories, where ownership cannot be easily proven. The 
manual nature of the process often causes delays, reduces operational efficiency, and lacks the 
accountability required in a structured institutional environment. As Ismail et al. (2025) 
highlight, integrating technologies such as RFID within campus operations improves both 
security and traceability by enabling the system to uniquely associate users with specific actions 
or transactions. 
 
Similar verification issues have been observed in UTeM and UTHM’s systems, where claims 
are processed through basic online forms or over -the-counter questioning, lacking secure and 
traceable ownership validation. Without biometric or ID -based checks, these  systems are 
vulnerable to fraud or mistaken identity. 
 
To address these issues, Qreclaim introduces a structured and secure verification approach 
through its prototype kiosk system. Students who wish to reclaim a lost item must first use the 
Qreclaim app to generate a personal QR code. This QR code is embedded  with both the 
student’s ID and facial data captured during registration. For valuable items, an admin approval 
process is required before QR generation, adding an extra layer of security. When the student 
visits the prototype kiosk, the system scans the QR code, automatically retrieving the encoded 
student ID and face data for further verification. 
 
This two-step authentication mechanism not only ensures that the student claiming the item is 
likely the rightful owner, but it also helps prevent fraudulent claims. In cases where an item is 
mistakenly released to a person who is later found not to be the  actual owner, the system still 
retains their registered student ID and facial data for post-investigation. This tracking capability 

--- PAGE 31 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 30 
allows administrators to identify, trace, and take appropriate actions against individuals 
attempting to commit fraud, thereby enhancing overall accountability and trust in the lost-and-
found process. 
 
Poor Usability and Lack of Human Centered Design  
One of the often -overlooked issues in the current campus lost and found systems is poor 
usability. These systems, if any exist, are typically not designed with the end -user in mind. 
Interfaces are either too basic like spreadsheet logs and Facebook posts or too cluttered, making 
it hard for users to intuitively know how to report, search, or claim an item. There is no 
structured user feedback mechanism, and very few institutions ever conduct usability testing. 
As a result, users often feel frustrated or over whelmed, especially when trying to report a lost 
item in a stressful situation. 
 
From a Human -Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective, this creates a serious barrier to 
adoption. Students and staff are unlikely to use or trust a system that feels confusing or 
inconsistent. This usability gap not only reduces engagement but also contributes to more lost 
items remaining unclaimed. Bringula and Basa (2011) emphasized that system usability is a 
key factor affecting user satisfaction, and poor navigation or design directly impacts system 
adoption. 
 
Many of the university systems studied, including those from TAR UMT’s Facebook group 
and formal systems at UMP and UTHM, do not prioritize usability. Interfaces often lack mobile 
optimization, use unintuitive layouts, and fail to follow standard HCI heuri stics. This 
discourages repeated use and limits the effectiveness of the system in high -stress moments 
when students urgently need assistance. 
 
To address this, Qreclaim is built with usability and user-centered design as key priorities. The 
interface uses a clean, mobile -responsive layout with simple forms, meaningful icons, and 
progressive disclosure of options to avoid overwhelming first -time u sers. The design also 
follows established HCI heuristics such as those by Nielsen (2024), ensuring that users receive 
consistent feedback, error prevention, and visibility of system status. These design decisions 
aim to make the system easy to use, even fo r non -technical users, thus promoting wider 
adoption.

2.3 Target Market 
The Qreclaim system is designed specifically for a campus environment, with its target users being 
students and staff of TAR UMT Johor. These individuals frequently move between various 
facilities across the campus throughout the day, increasing the likeli hood of misplacing personal 
belongings. As such, there is a clear need for a centralized, reliable, and user -friendly digital 
platform that enables efficient reporting, searching, and claiming of lost items. By focusing on this 
user group, Qreclaim is tailored to the behavioral patterns, routines, and technological familiarity 
of campus users within a higher education setting. 
2.3.1 TAR UMT Johor Students 
Students represent the primary user group of Qreclaim , as they are the most frequent individuals 
affected by item loss on campus. At the TAR UMT Johor branch, students regularly move between 
the library, the ICT Centre (which contains numerous computer laboratories and classrooms), the 
ICT Business Centre (c anteen), the DKC Block (lecture halls), the DSA Block (which includes 
gym and swimming pool facilities), and Block F. These high -traffic areas are common locations 
where personal items such as water bottles, power banks, books, umbrellas, student ID cards, and 
electronic accessories are often misplaced. 
 
In the absence of a centralized system, students are typically forced to rely on informal 
communication platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook to search for lost items. This 
fragmented approach leads to confusion and inefficiency, requiring stud ents to physically visit 
different buildings or offices to inquire about their belongings. The emotional stress associated 
with losing important items  such as a student ID required for examination access  further 
exacerbates the problem. 
 


--- PAGE 33 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 32 
The Qreclaim system addresses these challenges by offering a centralized, web -based platform 
through which students can submit reports for lost items, browse categorized found item listings, 
and receive claim status updates. Features such as AI -powered visual matching, location -based 
filtering, and submission tracking enhance the item recovery process and reduce unnecessary effort. 
As noted by Bringula and Basa (2011), user-centered design that aligns with the specific behaviors 
and needs of the target audience is essential for maximizing system usability and engagement.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 33 
2.3.2 TAR UMT Johor Staff 
Staff members  including security personnel, faculty assistants, and administrative personnel  
represent secondary yet critical users within the Qreclaim system. These individuals are directly 
involved in handling found items, ranging from initial acceptance and data recording to secure 
storage and facilitating the final item claim process. At prese nt, these tasks are typically carried 
out manually using physical logbooks or basic spreadsheets. Such methods are not only time  
consuming but also highly susceptible to human error, data inconsistency, and loss of information 
over time. 
 
In addition, staff members often face difficulties in verifying item ownership, especially when 
multiple students claim visually similar items such as black water bottles or plain pencil cases. 
Without technological support, the verification process is bas ed primarily on subjective verbal 
descriptions and the staff's personal memory or judgment. This lack of a standardized verification 
protocol heightens the risk of misidentifying the rightful owner, which may lead to administrative 
disputes, loss of user trust, and increased workload. 
 
Qreclaim addresses these inefficiencies by offering a structured and secure platform. Through 
digital logging, staff can now record found items along with rich metadata and supporting images, 
enabling more precise item tracking and retrieval. The system al so facilitates automatic item -
student matching, allowing staff to view potential matches based on reported lost items submitted 
by students. Furthermore, identity verification is streamlined with integrated RFID student ID 
scanning and facial recognition f eatures, which reduce reliance on staff intuition and provide a 
clear audit trail. 
 
Beyond operational improvements, Qreclaim also equips staff with analytics capabilities. The 
system collects and visualizes data trends related to item categories, frequency of claims, peak lost-
and-found periods, and commonly misplaced items. This insight allows administrators to identify 
recurring issues, optimize locker usage, plan for resource allocation, and even launch awareness 
campaigns to reduce item loss. These features contribute to a more accountable and data -driven 
environment, aligning with Bringula and Basa’s (2011) observation that user satisfaction is closely 
tied to how effectively a system supports core institutional workflows and decision -making 
processes.

2.4 Domain Research 
This section highlights the key technologies, frameworks, and tools selected to implement the 
Qreclaim system. Each technology has been carefully chosen to fulfill specific system 
requirements, including secure item claim verification, real -time updates, i ntelligent item 
matching, and cross -platform deployment. Domain research not only supports technical 
feasibility but also justifies the decision -making process by referencing proven methods in 
similar academic or enterprise-level systems.  
2.4.1 Firebase (Google Cloud Platform) 
Firebase (Figure 2.7) is adopted as the primary backend infrastructure for Qreclaim  due to its 
real-time capabilities, scalability, and strong integration with mobile and web platforms. 
Firestore, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database within Firebase, is used to store item records, user 
profiles, and images, allowing seamless and consistent data updates across devices even during 
intermittent connectivity (Firebase, 2024). Firebase Authentication enables secure user login 
linked to institutional credentials (e.g., student IDs), while Firebase Storage provides a scalable 
solution for hosting item images. 
 
Additionally, Firebase ML Kit assists in detecting and labeling images upon upload, which 
helps in generating searchable item tags. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Cloud 
Functions are used to push instant notifications, such as status updates on matched  or claimed 
items. These cloud services support scalability and responsiveness, making Firebase an ideal 
choice over more traditional self-hosted alternative.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 35 
2.4.2 Python & Flask / FastAPI 
Python is selected as the core backend programming language for implementing business logic 
and AI functionalities due to its extensive library ecosystem and ease of integration. 
Frameworks like Flask or FastAPI are lightweight, fast, and well -suited for building RESTful 
APIs, allowing Qreclaim to manage user actions, perform item tagging, and integrate with 
machine learning inference engines. 
 
Python also enables integration with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV  tools that power 
image processing and facial recognition. This versatility makes Python a suitable foundation 
for rapid prototyping and production-ready deployment.  
2.4.3 Hugging Face Transformers (CLIP/BLIP) 
To overcome the limitations of manual keyword -based searches, Qreclaim integrates pre -
trained transformer-based AI models such as CLIP and BLIP from Hugging Face (Figure 2.8). 
These models convert both images and textual descriptions into embeddings, allow ing for 
semantic similarity matching. For example, when a user submits a lost item report with a 
description, the system can retrieve visually similar found items even if the keywords do not 
match exactly. 
 
Radford et al. (2021) demonstrated that CLIP performs well in zero-shot visual understanding 
tasks, making it suitable for situations with incomplete or ambiguous data. Similarly, BLIP (Li 
et al., 2023) enhances visual -language alignment and caption genera tion, which is crucial for 
automatically generating descriptive tags from uploaded item photos. In this project, CLIP and 
BLIP are not developed from scratch but integrated as existing models via the Hugging Face 
platform. This integration can be achieved either through the Hugging Face Inference API for 
cloud-based processing or by downloading the pre-trained models and running them locally on 
the system’s backend server. 
 
By leveraging these state-of-the-art models, Qreclaim significantly improves item tagging and 
matching accuracy. The integration ensures that users can quickly find their lost belongings, 
reducing reliance on exact keyword matches and increasing retrieval efficiency.

Figure 2.8 Hugging Face 
2.4.4 You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) 
To ensure that AI -generated tags describe the main lost item rather than the surrounding 
background, Qreclaim applies an advanced object detection model from the YOLO family, 
specifically YOLOv8, as a preprocessing stage. The role of YOLO is to detect bounding boxes 
around objects in uploaded images, allowing the system to crop and isolate each item before 
passing it to captioning and embedding models such as BLIP and CLIP. This object -isolation 
process minimizes the influence of background features, suppor ts cases where multiple items 
appear in a single photo by producing one crop per detected object, and ultimately improves 
the accuracy and reliability of tag generation. 
 
In this project, YOLO is not developed from scratch but integrated using pre -trained weights, 
with the possibility of fine-tuning on a curated dataset of campus-related items. For deployment, 
lightweight YOLO models or optimized inference builds can run directly on a Raspberry Pi to 
support real-time detection during item intake. When more computational power is required, 
inference can be redirected to a backend server (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) with GPU support, 
where the Raspberry Pi transmits either the or iginal image or an initial crop for further 
processing. 
 
The detection and tagging pipeline operates as follows: first, an image is submitted to Qreclaim; 
second, YOLO generates bounding boxes with associated confidence scores; third, each 
bounding box is cropped and normalized; fourth, the cropped regions are p assed to BLIP for 
captioning and to CLIP for embedding and verification; and finally, the generated captions are 
transformed into standardized tags for similarity -based matching in the database. To further 
improve detection performance for locally relevant categories such as student ID cards, wallets, 
or bottles, YOLO may also be fine-tuned using tools like OIDv4_ToolKit in combination with 
the Open Images dataset.

Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 37 
By integrating YOLO as a targeted preprocessing step, Qreclaim minimizes false positives 
caused by background details, enables effective handling of images containing multiple items, 
and strengthens the accuracy of BLIP/CLIP -based tagging and matching. Thi s design choice 
significantly enhances the overall reliability and retrieval effectiveness of the system (Redmon 
et al., 2016). 
 
2.4.5 OpenCV & Facial Recognition 
OpenCV is a widely used open-source computer vision library integrated into Qreclaim  to 
support face detection and verification tasks. During claim processes, the system uses a webcam 
or Raspberry Pi camera to capture and verify the user’s face in real -time. OpenCV helps with 
preprocessing images (e.g., converting to grayscale, cropping, aligning) before comparing them 
to registered facial templates. 
 
This biometric verification method, when combined with RFID scanning, increases both 
accuracy and accountability. According to Singh and Sharma (2021), multimodal 
authentication (i.e., using both face and RFID) significantly reduces the chances of false claims 
and identity spoofing enhancing trust and security in unattended self-service environments like 
kiosks. 
2.4.6 RFID Tagging with Raspberry Pi & RC522 Modules 
Qreclaim uses RFID technology to identify student cards and, optionally, tag found items. The 
system integrates an RC522 RFID reader module with a Raspberry Pi to retrieve student data 
during claim verification. This low-cost hardware setup is commonly used in IoT-based student 
systems and has been tested in campus-level projects, such as the RFID lost-and-found system 
at UiTM Arau (Ilias, 2020). 
 
The RFID mechanism allows for quick, touchless identification, especially useful in kiosk -
based claim stations. In Qreclaim, RFID data is securely linked to Firebase-stored profiles and 
paired with biometric verification to ensure legitimate item retrieval. The combination 
improves usability and tamper resistance while remaining budget -friendly for educational 
institutions.

2.5 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
This chapter has presented a comprehensive review of literature and technologies related to the 
development of the Qreclaim system. It began by addressing four key limitations in the existing 
lost and found processes at TAR UMT Johor: the absence of a cent ralized and structured 
reporting mechanism, the lack of automated item matching, unreliable claim verification 
methods, and the absence of user -centered usability design. These limitations not only cause 
inefficiencies in item recovery but also contribute to miscommunication, unverified claims, and 
a lack of accountability within the current manual-based system. 
 
To overcome these issues, Qreclaim is proposed as a smart and integrated solution tailored to a 
campus environment. It leverages cloud -based infrastructure, AI -powered image processing, 
and RFID or facial recognition for secure claim verification. These technologies work together 
to streamline workflows, reduce manual errors, and enhance user confidence in the lost and 
found system. 
 
An analysis of the target market highlighted that TAR UMT students and staff frequently 
interact with multiple campus zones such as the library, ICT Centre, DKC Block, and DSA 
Block. By understanding the movement patterns and behavioral context of users in  these 
locations, Qreclaim is designed to be both accessible and contextually relevant. This market 
insight ensures that usability is prioritized across all user interactions. 
 
The chapter also reviewed multiple similar university systems to extract insights and identify 
performance gaps. For example, UKM's FoundeLost system digitized item reporting but lacked 
intelligent matching and identity verification features (Tan & Chong, 2024). UiTM's RFID -
based notification system introduced automation but did not address usability design or 
intelligent classification of found items (Ilias, 2020). UNIMAS and UTeM implemented basic 
web systems, yet both relied heavily on manual processing and offered limited user verification 
features (Sadiah & Nyambong, 2020; Shamshur & Nabilah, 2016). These systems demonstrate 
that while progress has been made toward digitization, gaps still exist in secure verification and 
AI integration areas in which Qreclaim provides significant improvements. 
 
From a technical perspective, this chapter justified the selection of tools used in Qreclaim’s 
implementation. Firebase was chosen for its robust cloud scalability and real -time database 
capabilities (Firebase, 2024), while Python and FastAPI serve as efficient back-end frameworks 

--- PAGE 40 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 2 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 39 
for handling AI -based tasks. The integration of advanced models like CLIP (Radford et al., 
2021) and BLIP (Li et al., 2023), in combination with OpenCV and RFID hardware, enables 
the system to generate accurate tags, enhance visual matching, and ensure sec ure identity 
validation. These components were selected based on established academic research and their 
proven performance in similar applications, confirming the technical feasibility of the proposed 
approach. 
 
In conclusion, the literature review and related studies in this chapter support the formulation 
of Qreclaim’s core objectives and validate its overall feasibility. The analysis demonstrates how 
Qreclaim addresses the specific challenges faced by the current system at TAR UMT Johor by 
applying modern technologies and user-centered principles. The insights gathered here provide 
a strong conceptual and technical foundation for the system design and implementation phases 
that follow in subsequent chapters.

Methodology and Requirements 
Analysis

3 Methodology and Requirements Analysis 
This chapter outlines the methodological approach and the process of identifying and analyzing 
the requirements for the Qreclaim system. The methodology describes the software development 
model adopted for the project and justifies its suitability in guiding the development process. The 
requirements analysis section details how information was collected, recorded, and analyzed to 
derive both functional and non-functional requirements of the system. By systematically applying 
requirement recording techniques  and fact analysis tools such as input/output analysis, decision 
tables, and structure charts, the collected data were transformed into a structured Software 
Requirements Specification (SRS). This chapter therefore establishes the foundation for the 
subsequent system design, ensuring that the proposed solution is technically feasible, user -
centered, and aligned with the objectives of improving the campus lost-and-found process. 
3.1 Methodology 
The Incremental Model is a software development methodology that delivers the system in 
smaller, functional increments rather than as a single, final product. Each increment involves a 
complete cycle of requirements gathering, design, implementation, and t esting, resulting in a 
working subset of the system that can be evaluated before moving to the next stage. Unlike the 
linear Waterfall model, incremental development allows partial deployment and early feedback, 
making it easier to refine the system progre ssively. According to GeeksforGeeks (2024), this 
model enables early delivery of core features, simplifies error detection through modularity, and 
allows feedback -driven improvements between iterations. This ensures a balance between 
structured planning and flexibility, which is particularly beneficial in research-oriented projects. 
 
For this project, the Incremental Model was selected because it aligns with the modular and 
testable nature of the system while still maintaining a structured development process. Academic 
projects benefit from incremental delivery as they enable the resea rcher to focus on one 
functional area at a time, ensuring higher quality before moving on to the next. Since the proposed 
system consists of interdependent modules including authentication, AI-powered image tagging, 
automated lost –found item matching, RFID -based claim verification, and kiosk integration 
developing these features incrementally reduces the risk of large -scale integration issues and 
allows for earlier usability testing. Additionally, this approach supports supervisor feedback at 
multiple points, making it easier to adjust system features or workflows without reworking the 
entire project. 
 

--- PAGE 43 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 42 
In applying this methodology, the project will progress through several iterative cycles, with each 
cycle targeting a specific set of features. During the requirements analysis of each increment, 
fact-gathering techniques such as observation and interviews  will be used to refine user needs, 
which will then be captured in an updated Software Requirement Specification (SRS). The design 
phase will translate these requirements into architectural models, database schemas, and interface 
mockups for the targeted m odule, using tools such as Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), 
flowcharts, and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. Implementation will focus on 
coding and integrating the selected feature set, beginning with fundamental modules like user 
authentication before advancing to higher-level components such as AI-powered image tagging, 
RFID verification, and kiosk operation. 
 
Testing will be conducted for every increment to ensure reliability and consistency before 
integration into the full system. Unit testing will verify each module independently, while 
integration testing will confirm that newly developed modules work seamle ssly with existing 
ones. For example, the automated matching and image tagging components will be evaluated 
using accurate metrics such as precision and recall, whereas RFID verification will be tested in 
real scenarios to confirm its reliability. After su ccessful testing, the increment will be deployed 
in a controlled environment, such as a campus pilot, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback 
before the next cycle begins. 
 
Figure 3.1 shows the Incremental Model process flow adopted for this project. The diagram 
shows how development begins with requirements definition and architecture design, followed 
by the construction of the first subsystem. Each subsequent subsystem is built and integra ted in 
a stepwise manner, with verification tests performed at each stage to ensure correctness. Finally, 
the fully integrated system undergoes validation testing to confirm that all requirements have 
been met. This staged approach mirrors the planned development of the Qreclaim system, where 
early increments will deliver foundational functionality such as user authentication and item 
reporting, while later increments will integrate advanced modules like AI -powered image 
tagging, automated matching, and kiosk-based verification. By following this model, each phase 
produces a usable and testable outcome, reducing integration risks and ensuring that issues are 
detected early rather than at the end of development.

BMCS3403 Project I 43 
 
Figure 3.1 Incremental Model 
 
By adopting the Incremental Model, the project gains both structure and flexibility. Each 
increment produces a tangible, working version of the system, which ensures continuous progress 
tracking and early risk detection. The combination of modular development, frequent testing, and 
stakeholder feedback supports the creation of a robust and user-centered solution that meets the 
project’s objectives while minimizing last -minute issues. This methodology is therefore well -
suited to the development of a complex,  multi-module system within the constraints of a final -
year project. 
3.2 Requirements Gathering Techniques (Fact Gathering) 
To ensure that the requirements of the Qreclaim system are accurately defined and aligned with 
user expectations, several fact -gathering techniques were applied during the early stages of 
development. Requirements gathering is a critical process in system development, as it helps 
bridge the gap between user needs and the final system design (Al-Badi, 2018). For this project, 
both qualitative and quantitative approaches were considered, ensuring that the collected 
requirements reflected both functional and non-functional perspectives.

BMCS3403 Project I 44 
3.2.1 Research 
Research was carried out to understand the main problems in the current lost and found process. 
This included reading academic papers, looking at system documentation, and reviewing case 
studies from other universities. The research showed that manual systems often have problems 
like unstructured reporting, slow or no matching of lost and found items, and weak claim 
verification. These findings became the basis for proposing new solutions such as AI-powered 
image tagging and RFID verification. The use of AI APIs is especially powerful because they 
can automatically identify and tag objects from images, making the process faster and reducing 
human error. According to Sommerville (2020), research is a valuable fact -gathering method 
for identifying best practic es and ensuring that new systems address real -world problems 
effectively. 
3.2.2 Observation 
Observation was done directly at TAR UMT Johor campus to see how the lost and found 
process works in real situations. This included watching how students report missing items, 
how staff keep records, and how they confirm who owns an item before returning i t. The 
observation showed problems such as manual record -keeping and dependence on informal 
communication channels like word of mouth.  As shown in Figure 3. 2, many lost items were 
observed being placed openly in a common area without a structured storage o r claim 
verification process. This practice highlights the lack of a centralized and secure system, where 
items are at risk of being misplaced or claimed by the wrong person. These findings matched 
what students and staff said during interviews and showed that automation is needed to improve 
the process. As Glinz (2020) states, observation helps capture what really happens in practice, 
which can sometimes be different from what people say in interviews.

BMCS3403 Project I 45 
3.2.3 Questionnaire 
A questionnaire was created using Google Forms (Appendix 1.1 ) and shared with students 
through social media groups so they could easily access and fill it in. The questionnaire 
contained a mix of question types, including multiple-choice questions, Likert scale questions 
(to measure agreement with statements), and a  few open -ended questions for additional 
feedback (Appendix 1.2 – Appendix 1.14). This combination allowed both quantitative and 
qualitative data to be collected, making the results more reliable and meaningful. The responses 
confirmed common issues such as delays in retrieving items, the absence of a notification 
system, and challenges in proving item ownership. Questionnaires were chosen because they 
allow collecting feedback from many people in a short amount of time, which is helpful to 
support the findings from interviews and observations (Pacheco & García, 2019). 
3.3 Requirements Analysis (Fact Analysis) 
Requirements Analysis is a foundational phase in the systems development lifecycle, focused on 
identifying, defining, and documenting the needs and constraints that a new system must fulfill. 
For the Qreclaim system, this process involves gathering quantitative and qualitative data directly 
from primary stakeholders students and administrative staff to formulate a clear and justified set 
of requirements. This ensures the final product is not based on assumption but is rigorously 
aligned with user expectations and operational realities, thereby maximizing its potential for 
adoption and success. The ana lysis synthesizes feedback from 20 survey respondents, and its 
outcomes directly inform the system's architectural design and feature prioritization, serving as 
a critical bridge between user needs and technical implementation. 
 
The questionnaire results formed the empirical foundation for the Qreclaim system requirements. 
The survey gathered 20 valid responses, comprising 19 students primarily from the Faculty of 
Computing and Information Technology (FOCS) and the Faculty of Acco untancy, Finance and 
Business (FAFB), and one staff member from the DCIT department. A thorough analysis of this 
dataset highlights not only the significant deficiencies in the current manual lost -and-found 
process but also precisely identifies the feature s, workflows, and quality attributes that users 
expect from a digital, AI-enhanced solution. The findings are systematically organized into three 
core parts: (i) an analysis of current process deficiencies that justify the project's necessity, (ii) a 
derivation of functional requirements that define the system's features, and (iii) a derivation of 
non-functional requirements that establish the system's quality standards.

BMCS3403 Project I 46 
3.3.1 Analysis of Current Process Deficiencies 
The survey data establishes an unequivocal and pressing need for systemic intervention. A 
significant majority of student respondents (73.7%, n=14/19, Figure 3.3) rated the existing lost-
and-found process at TAR UMT as “Average” (3) or worse on a 5-point scale, with over 42% 
(n=8/19) rating it as "Poor" (2) or "Very Poor" (1) (Appendix 2.6). This overwhelming 
sentiment indicates a process that is failing to meet b asic user expectations for efficiency, 
transparency, and reliability. A qualitative analysis of  the specific problems faced (Q5, 
Appendix 2.7) reveals four recurring and interconnected pain points that collectively define the 
systemic failures of the existing, fragmented approach. 
 
Figure 3.3 Student Response 
 
Absence of a Centralized Platform – This was the most prominent problem, cited by 63.2% of 
student respondents (n=12/19, Figure 3.4). The current reliance on disparate, isolated locations 
(e.g., faculty offices, security desks, hostels) creates an inefficient and frustrating user 
experience. Individuals must rely on word -of-mouth or physically visit multiple locations to 
report or inquire about items, a process that is time -consuming and often figuring. This 
fragmentation drastically increases the probability of items remaining unclaimed and creates a 
inconsistent, confusing experience for users. 
 
Lack of Proactive Communication – 57.9% of respondents (n=11/19, Figure 3.4) reported the 
absence of proper notifications or updates. The current process is almost entirely reactive, 
placing the burden of follow-up entirely on the user. Without proactive communication, users 
are quickly discouraged, leading to abandoned searches and prolonged item recovery times, if 
recovery happens at all. This deficiency highlights the critical need for automated feedback 
mechanisms to close the loop between item discovery and owner retrieval. 


--- PAGE 48 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 47 
 
Ineffective Ownership Verification – 42.1% of respondents (n=8/19 , Figure 3.4 ) highlighted 
significant difficulties in proving ownership of a found item. The ad -hoc nature of the current 
process lacks a standardized, reliable method for verification, which acts as a barrier for 
legitimate owners and introduces substantial security risks. It creates opportunities for false 
claims, misappropriation, and impersonation, undermining trust in the entire system. 
 
Processing Delays – 31.6% of respondents (n=6/19 , Figure 3.4 ) cited noticeable delays in 
retrieving items even after they were located. These delays, often caused by bureaucratic 
hurdles or the inability to locate the staff member holding the item, further erode user trust and 
increase the likelihood that items will be permanently lost or forgotten. 
 
 
Figure 3.4 Existing Problems Response 
 
Taken together, these deficiencies paint a clear picture of a process that is manual, opaque, and 
inefficient. They provide a compelling justification for the core purpose of the Qreclaim system: 
to replace this outdated model with a standardized, transparent, and efficient digital ecosystem 
that benefits all stakeholders. 
3.3.2 Derivation of Functional Requirements 
The user feedback strongly validated the proposed feature set of Qreclaim , allowing for the 
derivation of specific, data -driven Functional Requirements (FRs). These FRs form the 
blueprint for the system's architecture and development, ensuring every feature addresses an 
expressed user need or pain point. 
 
FR1 – Centralized Digital Platform 
The concept of a unified, online platform for all lost-and-found activities was deemed “Useful” 
or “Very Useful” (rated 4 or 5) by 84.2% of student respondents (n=16/19, Appendix 2.8, Figure 
3.5). This overwhelming support mandates the development of a centralised system that acts as 


--- PAGE 49 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 48 
a single source of truth. This requirement directly translates into the creation of two core 
modules: a User Module for students to report and claim items, and an Admin Module for staff 
to manage the process, thereby solving the primary pain point of fragmentation. 
 
Figure 3.5 Centralized System Important Response 
 
FR2 – Multimedia Support for Item Reporting 
Respondents placed high importance on the ability to upload photographs, with 89.4% 
(n=17/19) rating it a 4 or 5 (mean score ~4.4/5, Appendix 2.9). This functionality is crucial as 
visual evidence significantly enhances the accuracy of item descriptions, a ids owners in 
identifying their property, and reduces the potential for false claims. Consequently, the Lost 
and Found Module must be designed with robust image upload capabilities, including client -
side cropping and resizing to optimize user experience an d server storage, and secure cloud 
storage for efficient retrieval. 
 
FR3 – Advanced Search and Filtering 
An overwhelming 94.7% of student respondents (n=18/19, Appendix 2.10) confirmed a strong 
preference (answered "Yes") for browsing and searching items by attributes such as category, 
location, and date. This feedback necessitates the implementation of an ad vanced, intuitive 
search interface powered by optimized database queries and indexed metadata. The goal is to 
minimize the time and effort required for users to locate their lost items, directly addressing the 
inefficiencies of the current process. 
 
FR4 – Secure, Dual-Factor Claim Verification  
The survey revealed strong user demand for a secure claiming process. A significant 89.5% of 
respondents (n=17/19, Appendix 2.11) agreed or strongly agreed (rated 4 or 5) that claiming 
items should require a system -generated QR code. Furthermore, 78.9% (n= 15/19, Appendix 
2.12) expressed a preference for using an RFID student card as a secondary verification factor 
over facial recognition or having no preference. These responses directly guide the design of 
the Prototype Kiosk Module, which will implement a dual-factor authentication mechanism 


--- PAGE 50 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 49 
(QR code + RFID) to ensure that only the legitimate owner can claim an item, thereby solving 
the critical problem of ownership verification. 
 
FR5 – AI-Powered Image Tagging and Matching 
The proposed AI-powered features were among the most positively received innovations. AI -
based automatic image tagging (e.g., generating tags like “black wallet,” “red umbrella”) was 
rated 4 or 5 by 73.7% of respondents (n=14/19, Appendix 2.14 , Figure 3.6 ). Even more 
compelling, the feature for receiving automatic notifications upon a found item matching a lost 
report was rated 4 or 5 by 84.2% (n=16/19, Appendix 2.15). This strong validation supports the 
inclusion of an AI Image Analysis Module for automat ed tag generation and an AI Tag 
Matching Module to provide real -time notifications, transforming the system from a passive 
database into a proactive recovery tool. 
 
Figure 3.6 AI Feature Response 
 
FR6 – Admin Approval Workflow for Valuables 
The concept of requiring administrator approval for high -value items (wallets, electronics, ID 
cards) received the most unanimous support, with 94.7% of student respondents (n=18/19) 
rating it 4 or 5 (mean score ~4.4/5, Appendix 2.13). This requirement ens ures a differentiated 
security workflow where such items are placed in a secure holding state. A designated 
administrator must manually verify the claimant's identity and approve the release within the 
system before a QR code for claiming is generated. Thi s is implemented within the Lost and 
Found Module as a crucial additional security layer to protect sensitive and high-value assets.

Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 50 
3.3.3 Derivation of Non-Functional Requirements 
Beyond defining what the system should do, the survey identified critical quality attributes that 
define how well the Qreclaim system must perform. These Non -Functional Requirements 
(NFRs) establish measurable benchmarks for system design, ensuring it is r obust, secure, and 
user-friendly. 
 
NFR1 – Performance 
System responsiveness is a critical user expectation. 65% of all respondents (n=13/20) rated 
fast system response times (e.g., less than 5 seconds for search or tagging) as “Very Important” 
(5). When including those who rate it a 4, this importance rises t o 90% (n=18/20, Appendix 
2.17). This sets a strict performance benchmark that influences key architectural decisions, 
necessitating the use of caching strategies, optimized database indexing, efficient algorithms, 
and asynchronous processing for long-running tasks like AI tagging to maintain a snappy and 
responsive user interface underload. 
 
NFR2 – Security and Data Privacy 
Data protection was the highest -rated concern among all quality attributes. 80% of all 
respondents (n=16/20) rated the protection of personal data (IDs, RFID tags, facial recognition 
data) as “Very Important” (5), and 95% (n=19/20) rated it a 4 or 5 (Appen dix 2.18). These 
findings mandate a security-first design approach. This includes end-to-end encryption of data 
in transit (HTTPS), robust hashing with salt for passwords, encryption of sensitive data at rest, 
adherence to the principle of least privilege through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and 
strict data governance policies to ensure user privacy is paramount. 
 
NFR3 – Reliability and Availability 
Users require a dependable system. System reliability (no frequent errors or downtime) was 
rated “Very Important” (5) by 65% of respondents (n=13/20), and 90% (n=18/20) when 
including a rating of 4 (Appendix 2.19). Furthermore, 90% of respondents (n=18/20, Appendix 
2.20) required the system to be available 24/7, not just during campus operating hours. These 
requirements justify the need for fault -tolerant architecture. This includes implementing 
automated monitoring, regular backups, redundant server compon ents, and a clear disaster 
recovery plan to ensure uninterrupted service and data integrity. 
 
NFR4 – Scalability and Future Expansion 
The strong consensus (95%, n=19/20, Appendix 2.21) that Qreclaim should be expanded to 
other TAR UMT campuses indicates that scalability must be a core design consideration from 
the outset. The database schema, application programming interface (API) desig n, and cloud 

--- PAGE 52 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 51 
server deployment strategy must all support horizontal scaling (adding more servers) and be 
designed with a multi-tenant architecture in mind to facilitate cost-effective and efficient future 
rollouts to other campuses. 
 
NFR5 – Administrative Utility and Insights 
The single staff respondent, whose role involves managing lost items, provided critical 
validation for administrative features. They rated a dashboard with statistics (e.g., most lost 
items, recovery time) as "Very Useful" (5) (Appendix 2.22) and also rate d remote locker 
management as "Very Important" (5) (Appendix 2.23). They also confirmed that admin 
approval for valuable items is helpful (Appendix 2.24). While from a single data point, this 
feedback is vital as it confirms that the proposed Admin Module features align with the practical 
needs of the staff who will ultimately operate and manage the system, ensuring its long -term 
operational sustainability. 
 
This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the Qreclaim system is meticulously designed 
to address explicitly identified deficiencies through a feature set validated by end-users, while 
also adhering to stringent quality standards for performance, security, and reliability. This user-
centered, data-driven approach forms a solid foundation for the system's subsequent design, 
implementation, and testing phases. 
 
 
3.4 Project Scope 
The Qreclaim  system is specifically developed for use within the TAR UMT Johor Branch 
campus and is currently designed for two main user groups: students and administrators. The 
student module allows students to report lost items, view matched found items and verify t heir 
claims. The administrator module enables staff to manage to find item records, approve claims 
for valuable items, and handle locker management. At this stage of development, administrators 
do not have access to student module functions, as the system is intentionally separated to 
maintain clear role boundaries. However, future enhancements are planned to introduce extended 
administrative access and additional integrated functions that could support more efficient 
oversight and improve the overall usability of the platform. 
 
Figure 3.4.1 illustrates the Qreclaim System Hierarchy Chart, and Figure 3.4.2 presents the 
Qreclaim Use Case Diagram, which together defines the overall functional scope of the project.

3.5 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a formal document that defines what the 
system is expected to do and the conditions under which it must operate. It provides a detailed 
description of both the functional requirements, which specify the feat ures and services the 
system must provide, and the non -functional requirements, which outline the quality attributes 
such as performance, security, usability, and reliability. The purpose of the SRS is to serve as a 
clear agreement between stakeholders, de velopers, and users, ensuring that the system is 
developed according to the intended objectives and meets the needs of its users. 
 
3.5.1 Functional Requirement 
The functional requirements of the Qreclaim  system are derived from its hierarchical 
architecture, which consists of both user -facing and administrative modules. Each module 
provides specific capabilities that collectively ensure a structured, intelligent, and secure lost -
and-found process within the campus environment. 
 
A. Users Module 
1. Account Management Module 
The Account Management Module governs access to the system. When users (students or staff) 
launch the Qreclaim web application, they are presented with a secure login interface. They 
must enter their institutional credentials (student or staff ID and passw ord) which are 
authenticated against the Firebase Authentication service. Upon successful verification, users 
gain access to the system dashboard based on their role. At the end of their session, users can 
log out to terminate their access. This process en sures that unauthorized individuals cannot 
access sensitive data or submit fraudulent reports. 
 
2. Lost and Found Module 
The Lost and Found Module forms the core of the system, allowing students to report and track 
misplaced items while also managing the process of reclaiming them. When a student loses an 
item, they complete a structured “Lost Item Report” form that captures key details such as the 
item name, category, location, and an optional photo. Similarly, when an item is found, a 
“Found Item Report” is submitted with supporting details and images, ensuring that all entries 
are stored in real -time through Firebase and v isible to other users. Students can also browse 

--- PAGE 56 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 55 
categorized records of lost and found items, applying filters such as category, location, or date 
to simplify the search process. 
 
The Lost and Found Module forms the core of the system, allowing students to browse, report, 
and reclaim items. Students are able to browse all available found items that have been posted 
by administrators, with the option to apply filters such as category, location, or date to narrow 
down the results and simplify their search process. When a student loses an item, they can use 
the “Report Lost Item” function to fill in the required information through a structured form, 
including details such as item name, category, and location. Once submitted, the report is sent 
to administrators, who will assist in checking records and notifying the student if a matching 
found item is identified. 
 
A key feature of this module is the ability to register a QR code for item claiming. The QR code 
acts as a digital token that links a student to a specific claim request and is mandatory for 
retrieval at the prototype kiosk. The registration process, howev er, differs depending on 
whether the item is categorized as valuable or non-valuable: 
 
For non-valuable items (e.g., stationery, umbrellas, water bottles), students can directly register 
a QR code after confirming their intent to claim. During this process, the system requires the 
student to first complete a facial recognition check, which serves as an initial verification step. 
Once their face is verified, they are prompted to select their preferred second verification 
method either RFID student card scanning or facial recognition which will be used later at the 
kiosk for completing the dual verification process. After these steps, the QR code is successfully 
generated and stored in the student’s profile. 
 
For valuable items (e.g., wallets, electronics, student ID cards), the QR registration process 
requires additional approval. When a student attempts to register a QR code for such items, the 
request is automatically sent to an administrator for review. The  administrator evaluates the 
claim based on the available records and supporting details. Only after the administrator grants 
approval can the student proceed with QR code registration. As with non -valuable items, the 
student must still complete the facial recognition step and select a preferred second verification 
method (RFID or face recognition) before the QR code is generated.

Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 56 
This distinction between valuable and non-valuable items ensures that higher-value possessions 
receive stricter oversight, while common items can still be reclaimed efficiently. Regardless of 
the category, the QR registration process guarantees that every claim is tied to a verified identity 
and a preselected verification method, thereby ensuring security and accountability at the kiosk. 
 
3. Prototype Kiosk Module 
The Prototype Kiosk Module provides secure item claim verification through a dual -factor 
authentication process. When a student arrives at the kiosk to retrieve their item, they must first 
present their QR code for scanning. The system validates the QR cod e and retrieves the 
student’s chosen verification method, which was specified during QR registration. The student 
then completes the second step of verification using either facial recognition or RFID student 
card scanning, depending on the option they selected earlier. 
• Facial Recognition Path: The kiosk camera captures a live image of the student and 
compares it to the registered facial template. If the match is successful, the claim 
process continues. 
• RFID Path: The student taps their registered RFID enabled student card on the kiosk 
reader. The card ID is verified against the student’s profile in the database. 
Only when both steps are successfully completed will the system instruct the kiosk locker to 
unlock and release the stored item. This process ensures that items are claimed only by their 
rightful owners, with every transaction logged securely for accountability. 
 
B. Admins Module 
1. Lost and Found Management Module 
The Lost and Found Management Module equips administrators with tools for monitoring and 
controlling the system. When campus staff or security personnel submit found items, 
administrators verify the submissions and may attach additional details if needed. 
Administrators can browse both student -submitted lost item reports and existing found item 
records, allowing them to quickly cross -check and identify potential matches. They are also 
responsible for managing QR register requests by reviewing and approving or rejecting 
applications for valuable item claims. 
 
In addition, administrators are responsible for registering student RFID cards into the system 
to support future claim verifications. Beyond item management, administrators have access to 

--- PAGE 58 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 57 
a dashboard that provides analytics on lost -and-found trends, such as the most frequently 
misplaced items, average recovery times, and unclaimed item statistics. This data supports 
informed decision-making, for example, planning awareness campaigns or optimizing storage 
space. These combined capabilities ensure administrators can maintain a well -organized, 
secure, and efficient lost-and-found process. 
 
2. Prototype Kiosk Management Module 
The Prototype Kiosk Management Module allows administrators to oversee the physical kiosk 
lockers. They can remotely view locker availability, assign lockers to specific found items, and 
monitor locker usage. In cases of technical issues or disputes, admin istrators may manually 
override the system to lock or unlock a locker. These controls ensure that items are stored 
securely until retrieval and that the kiosk infrastructure remains reliable and tamper resistant. 
 
C. AI Features 
1. AI Image Tagging  
The AI Image Tagging feature is applied during both student lost item reporting and 
administrator found item reporting. When an image is uploaded, the system prompts the user 
to crop the photo to focus on the object of interest. The cropped image is then analyzed by the 
BLIP model, which automatically generates descriptive AI tags (e.g., “red water bottle,” “black 
wallet,” “blue umbrella”). These tags are stored as metadata in the database and linked to the 
item record. Users can review, add, or remove tags to ensure the description is accurate before 
submission. This process standardizes item descriptions and improves searchability for faster 
matching. 
2. AI Matching  
The AI Matching feature intelligently links lost and found records by comparing their generated 
tags. Each time a new report is submitted, the system performs a similarity comparison between 
the new record and existing records using semantic matching techn iques. For example, if a 
student reports a “black wireless mouse,” the system will search for found item records with 
similar tags and calculate a similarity score. If a strong match is detected, the student receives 
a notification with the potential match  details, enabling them to verify the result and proceed 
with QR code generation for claiming.

BMCS3403 Project I 58 
3.5.2 Non-Functional Requirement 
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) specify the quality attributes that define how a system 
performs its functions rather than what the functions are. Unlike functional requirements, which 
describe specific tasks such as item reporting or claim verification, NFRs determine the overall 
system qualities such as reliability, security, usability, and scalability. These attributes are 
particularly critical for Qreclaim, as the system is expected to handle sensitive student data and 
support AI -powered services lik e automated tagging and RFID verification. The following 
NFRs are essential to ensure Qreclaim meets both user expectations and institutional standards. 
 
Performance 
Performance is a key requirement for Qreclaim, as both students and administrators expect the 
system to deliver fast and seamless interactions. When reporting or searching for lost and found 
items, delays can cause frustration and reduce system adoption. Specifically, AI-powered image 
tagging, which automatically extracts metadata from uploaded item images, must be executed 
within a few seconds to provide real -time feedback. Similarly, database queries for lost and 
found matching should return results quickly, even as the number of records increases over 
time. If the system takes too long to respond, users may perceive it as  inefficient, which can 
directly reduce trust and usability. Therefore, Qreclaim must be optimized at both the 
application and database layers to ensure consistent performance. 
 
Usability 
Usability is crucial because the system targets a wide range of students, some of whom may not 
possess advanced technical skills. The interface of Qreclaim must be designed to be intuitive, 
with straightforward navigation and minimal learning effort. For e xample, the web platform 
should allow students to report or search for items in just a few steps, while the prototype kiosk 
must provide clear step -by-step instructions during claim verification using RFID or facial 
recognition. Prior studies confirm that usability directly impacts adoption rates in university 
service systems, where poorly designed interfaces discourage participation (Nielsen, 2012). By 
adhering to usability heuristics and prioritizing a user -centered design, Qreclaim can ensure 
inclusivity and encourage consistent usage.

Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 59 
Reliability 
Reliability ensures that Qreclaim consistently delivers its services without frequent errors, 
crashes, or data loss. Since the system is expected to store critical records of lost and found 
items, students must be confident that their data will not be corr upted or lost due to technical 
failures. The AI tagging module, RFID verification, and facial recognition components must 
operate with high accuracy and consistency, as even small errors could lead to wrongful claim 
approvals or unclaimed items. As emphasi zed in software engineering literature, reliability 
builds user trust and is one of the most important attributes of institutional systems that handle 
sensitive processes (Avizienis et al., 2004). Consequently, Qreclaim must implement thorough 
error handling, redundancy, and robust testing strategies to achieve this requirement. 
 
Security 
Security is one of the most critical attributes for Qreclaim, as it processes personal and sensitive 
data such as student IDs, face recognition profiles, and contact details. To prevent misuse or 
unauthorized access, the system must enforce strict authenti cation, access control, and 
encryption policies. For instance, claim verification must ensure that only the rightful owner of 
an item can retrieve it, whether through RFID scanning or facial recognition. As universities 
are often targets of data breaches, adherence to data protection principles such as 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability is mandatory (Shamala et al., 2017). By incorporating 
secure coding practices and compliance with relevant data protection regulations, Qreclaim can 
safeguard student information while maintaining trust and institutional credibility. 
 
Maintainability 
Maintainability refers to the ease with which Qreclaim can be updated, modified, or extended 
in the future. Since the system includes multiple components such as the student module, admin 
module, and AI tagging module, its architecture must be modular and well -documented. This 
will enable future developers to implement improvements, fix issues, or integrate new 
technologies without causing disruptions. Maintainability is also a critical factor in reducing 
the long-term cost of software ownership, as systems that lack modularity are harder to adapt 
to evolving requirements. For Qreclaim, maintainability ensures that the system remains 
sustainable and adaptable even after the initial deployment. 
 
 

--- PAGE 61 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 60 
Scalability 
Scalability is essential because Qreclaim was initially designed for TAR UMT Johor campus 
but has the potential to expand to other branches of the university. As more students, staff, and 
lost-and-found records are added to the system, its performance and reliability must not 
degrade. For example, the database must support a growing volume of records, while AI tagging 
should remain efficient as more images are processed daily. Studies confirm that scalability is 
fundamental for systems in educational institutions, as they often evolve from small -scale 
deployments to larger, multi -campus environments (Almorsy, Grundy, & Müller, 2016). By 
designing Qreclaim with scalability in mind, the system can support both current and future 
institutional needs without requiring major redesign. 
 
Availability 
Availability ensures that Qreclaim is accessible whenever users need it, particularly during 
university operational hours when students are most likely to report or search for items. 
Downtime can disrupt the lost-and-found process, leading to unclaimed items and reduced trust 
in the system. The web platform should achieve high uptime with mechanisms for fault 
tolerance and recovery in the event of system failures. As noted in research on availability 
engineering, even short downtimes can significantly affec t user satisfaction and institutional 
operations (Torres et al., 2017). By prioritizing high availability, Qreclaim guarantees 
continuous service delivery and reinforces reliability for students and administrators alike. 
 
3.6 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
This chapter presented the methodology and requirements analysis that form the foundation of 
Qreclaim’s development. The project adopts the Incremental Software Development Model, 
which breaks the development process into multiple, manageable increments rather than a single 
release. Each increment delivers a subset of system features, starting with essential components 
such as user and admin account management, structured lost-and-found reporting, and search and 
browsing functions. Subsequent increments focus on AI-powered features such as image tagging 
and similarity matching, followed by prototype kiosk integration for secure claim verification. 
This phased approach enables early release of core functionality, continuous requirement 
validation, iterative r efinement, and timely risk mitigation —an essential strategy for a time -
constrained academic project. 
 

--- PAGE 62 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 3 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 61 
The chapter also introduced a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that formally 
defines what Qreclaim must achieve and the conditions under which it will operate. The 
functional requirements were organized into clear modules for both students and administrators. 
For students, the system provides secure login/logout, the ability to submit lost item reports with 
image uploads and AI-generated tags, browse and filter items using advanced search options, and 
register QR codes to claim items. Dist inct workflows are implemented for valuable and non -
valuable items, with valuable items requiring administrator approval before QR code generation. 
Verification at the prototype kiosk uses dual-factor authentication, allowing students to validate 
ownership through QR code scanning and either RFID card verification or facial recognition. 
 
For administrators, the functional requirements specify key capabilities including posting found 
item reports with AI-generated tags, verifying and approving item records, managing QR register 
requests for valuables, assigning lockers, registering RFID cards, and monitoring claim activity. 
An analytics dashboard provides statistics such as the most frequently lost items and average 
claim times, while locker management functions enable remote control and manual override of 
the kiosk when required. Together, these features create a secure, structured, and transparent 
process for managing lost-and-found operations on campus. 
 
The non -functional requirements complement the functional aspects by focusing on critical 
quality attributes. Performance expectations include fast system response (<5 seconds), 
optimized database queries, and real -time synchronization through Firebase. Us ability 
requirements ensure that both the web interface and kiosk remain intuitive and user -friendly, 
lowering the learning curve for students. Reliability and availability requirements emphasize 
fault tolerance, automated backups, and 24/7 access to ensur e data integrity and minimal 
downtime. Security requirements enforce strict authentication, encryption, and role-based access 
control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data such as student IDs, RFID tags, and facial recognition 
records. Scalability and maintainability are also prioritized to support future expansion to other 
campuses and ensure the system remains adaptable to evolving needs. 
 
In conclusion, this chapter translates the findings from fact -finding and questionnaire analysis 
into a well -defined set of functional and non -functional requirements. The adoption of the 
incremental model ensures progressive delivery, early user feedback,  and continuous 
improvement, which are crucial for a multi -feature solution like Qreclaim. The comprehensive 
SRS serves as a shared reference point for all stakeholders, minimizing ambiguity and aligning 
expectations. By clearly defining both the system’s capabilities and quality standards, this chapter 
lays a solid groundwork for the design and implementation phases, ensuring Qreclaim is 
developed systematically and remains aligned with user needs and institutional objectives.

4 System Design 
In this phase, all analyzed system requirements will be transformed and visualized as several types 
of diagrams not only to help the development team for better understanding but also document 
readers. This chapter covers Software Architecture Design, Process Design, Data Design, Security 
Design, Report Design, and User Interface Design. 
4.1 Software Architecture Design 
Figure 4.1 shows the updated software architecture design of Qreclaim, which adopts a modular, 
layered approach to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security while fulfilling the functional 
requirements of the system. The architecture follows a three -tier structure comprising the 
Presentation Layer, Application Layer, and Data Layer, all connected via a RESTful API built 
with Flask. This layered design enforces a clear separation of concerns, simplifies debugging, 
and supports future enhancements such as improved AI matching, mobile application integration, 
or additional verification mechanisms. 
 
The Presentation Layer consists of two primary components: the Student/Admin Web Browser 
and the Prototype Kiosk. The web browser provides a responsive interface for students and 
administrators to report lost and found items, generate QR codes, manage clai ms, and monitor 
system activity. The Prototype Kiosk is designed to handle in -person claim verification by 
sending verification requests, such as RFID scans or facial recognition data, to the backend. All 
communication between this layer and the Flask API is secured via HTTPS, protecting sensitive 
user data during transmission. 
 
The Application Layer is the core of the system and is powered by the Flask API. It handles all 
incoming HTTPS requests, applies server -side validation, and coordinates communication 
between the front end and the database. This layer is organized into several key modules: 
 
• Login Authentication – Handles user login by validating credentials directly against Firestore 
collections, without relying on Firebase Authentication. 
• Session Management  – Maintains user sessions securely, ensuring that only authenticated 
users can access protected resources. 
• Users Module – Manages user profiles, including registration, updates, and access control. 
• Admins Module  – Provides administrators with management tools for overseeing reports, 
claims, and system operations. 

--- PAGE 65 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 4 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 64 
• AI Tagging and Matching Features – Uses AI models to automatically generate descriptive 
tags for found items and match them with reported lost items, reducing manual workload and 
improving efficiency. 
• Notification Module – Sends alerts to users when item matches are found or claim statuses are 
updated, improving user engagement and response time. 
 
The Data Layer is implemented using Firebase Firestore, a cloud -hosted NoSQL database. It 
stores structured data for users, lost and found items, claims, and system logs. Firestore’s real 
time update capability ensures that any data changes, such as new item postings or claim status 
updates, are immediately reflected in the web interface, creating a seamless user experience. All 
read and write operations are routed through the Flask API to ensu re centralized access control 
and data validation. 
 
Overall, this architecture is designed to be modular, secure, and scalable. Its clear separation of 
layers allows easy maintenance and future feature expansion, while its use of Flask as the API 
gateway ensures consistent request handling. By integrating AI-powered tagging, matching, and 
notification features, Qreclaim provides an efficient, intelligent, and user -friendly platform for 
automating TAR UMT Johor’s lost-and-found process.

4.2.1 Use Case Description 
A use case description is a textual representation that details how different actors interact with 
the system to achieve specific objectives. It outlines the preconditions, triggers, step -by-step 
interactions, alternative flows, and postconditions associated with each function. While the use 
case diagram provides a visual overview of the system, the use case description explains the 
processes in greater depth by capturing the logical sequence of actions and outcomes. In the 
context of Qreclaim, the use case  descriptions illustrate the complete working flows of the 
system, such as reporting a lost item, submitting a found item, verifying claims through RFID 
or facial recognition, and managing locker storage. By documenting these flows, the use case 
descriptions provide a clear understanding of how Qreclaim supports both students and 
administrators in streamlining the lost-and-found process. The following tables present the use 
case descriptions for each main function of the system.

4.3 Data Design 
The data design of Qreclaim  defines the overall structure and organization of information that 
supports the system’s operations. It specifies how data is stored, managed, and connected to 
ensure reliability, accuracy, and efficiency across all processes. Since Qreclaim is built to handle 
sensitive information such as student details, lost and found item records, and claim verification 
data, the data design plays a critical role in maintaining data integrity and security. A well -
planned data design also ensures that different modules of the system, such as item reporting, 
claim verification, and locker management, can work seamlessly together by relying on a 
consistent and structured data foundation.  
 
4.3.1 ERD Diagram 
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) models the logical structure of the Qreclaim database 
by identifying the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It provides 
a clear representation of how data related to users, lost items, found items, claims, and lockers 
are connected within the system. Through this diagram, the database structure ensures that each 
process such as reporting a lost item, submitting a found item, or verifying a claim supported 
by accurate and well -linked data. By organizing information into entities and defining their 
relationships, the ERD helps maintain data consistency, reduces redundancy, and ensures 
efficient retrieval of records, which is crucial for the smooth functioning of Qreclaim.  Figure 
4.15 shows the ERD diagram of Qreclaim system.

4.3.2 Class Diagram 
The class diagram represents Qreclaim  from an object -oriented perspective by modeling the 
system’s main classes, their attributes, methods, and associations. It translates the database 
structure into objects that interact with one another during system operations. In Qreclaim, the 
class diagram captures essential components such as users, items, claims, and lockers, along 
with their relationships and behaviors. This allows developers to understand not only how data 
is stored but also how it is manipulated within the application. By defining th ese classes and 
their interactions, the class diagram provides a blueprint for system implementation and ensures 
that the design remains consistent with the functional requirements.

4.3.3 Data Dictionary  
The data dictionary provides a detailed description of the collections and attributes used in the 
Qreclaim system. Since the system is built on Firestore, a NoSQL document-oriented database, 
attributes do not require fixed lengths as in relational database s (e.g., varchar (50)). Instead, 
each field is defined by general data types such as string, number, boolean, or timestamp. The 
data dictionary documents the key constraints, data types, nullability, and descriptions of each 
attribute, ensuring clarity and consistency in data management. The following tables(Table 4.13 
– Table 4.20) show the data dictionary of Qreclaim system.

4.4 Security Design 
The security design of Qreclaim  establishes the measures and mechanisms needed to protect 
sensitive data and ensure safe interactions between users and the system. Because the platform 
manages critical information such as student details, lost -and-found records, and identity 
verification data, it must be safeguarded against unauthorized access, misuse, and system threats. 
The design covers multiple layers of security, including access control, authentication, session 
management, data validation, and logging, as well as specific protectio ns for the kiosk, RFID, 
facial recognition, and QR-based claim process. By applying these measures, Qreclaim ensures 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information while maintaining user trust and system 
reliability. 
4.4.1 Access Control 
Qreclaim applies to a role-based access control (RBAC) model to ensure users can only perform 
permitted actions. Students can view their own profile, register QR codes, and submit claims, 
while administrators have additional permissions to approve valuable claims, manage lockers, 
and view all records. These permissions are enforced through Firebase security rules, which 
check the user’s role before allowing read or write operations. This approach follows 
established RBAC principles, where permissions are ti ed to roles and verified server -side to 
prevent privilege escalation (Firebase, n.d.; Sandhu et al., 1996). 
4.4.2 Authentication 
All users must authenticate via Firebase Authentication before interacting with the system. 
Students and staff log in with their registered credentials, while administrators use separate 
privileged accounts to access management features. Firebase Authentication helps ensure only 
verified users can perform actions, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized data access 
(Firebase, n.d.-b). 
4.4.3 Session Management 
Session tokens generated by Firebase maintain the login state and expire after a fixed period. 
When a token expires or a user remains inactive for too long, re-authentication is required. This 
reduces the risk of unauthorized users exploiting an unattended session (Firebase, n.d.-b). 
4.4.4 QR Token and Claim Security 
Each claim is associated with a unique QR code containing the claim ID and student ID. The 
kiosk verifies this code against Firestore before permitting the claim process to continue. Once 
the QR code is used, its status is updated so it cannot be reused, mitigating replay attacks. Using 
dynamic, single-use QR codes is a recommended countermeasure against QR code cloning and 
replay attempts (Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre 

--- PAGE 95 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 4 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 94 
[HKCERT], 2023; Pageloot, 2024). For valuable items, QR code registration is allowed only 
after administrative approval, ensuring only legitimate owners proceed. 
4.4.5 Biometric and RFID Security 
The kiosk supports RFID card scanning and facial recognition for additional verification. The 
scanned RFID UID or facial data is compared against stored records in Firestore. Only 
successful matches allow the locker to be unlocked. This multi -step verifica tion prevents 
unauthorized students from claiming items even if they gain access to a valid QR code. 
4.4.6 Input Validation 
Qreclaim validates all user inputs, such as student ID, item information, and claim details, on 
both the client and server sides. This prevents invalid or malicious data from being written into 
Firestore and maintains system reliability (OWASP Foundation, 2021). 
4.4.7 Logging 
The system records key actions such as QR code generation, claim attempts, verification 
results, and locker unlocking events. These logs provide administrators with the ability to 
trace activity, investigate misuse, and resolve disputes when necessary 
 
4.4.8 Kiosk Security 
The Raspberry Pi kiosk is configured to work only with Qreclaim’s backend. Locker unlocking 
occurs only after Firestore confirms the claim’s validity. Failed verifications are logged for 
administrator review, helping detect and prevent misuse at the kiosk level. 
 
4.5 Report Design 
The report design in Qreclaim focuses on presenting information in a professional, structured, 
and user-friendly format. Reports serve as an important feature for monitoring claim activities 
and providing administrators with accurate records of lost -and-found operations. To achieve 
clarity and readability, the design follows key reporting principles, ensuring that printed reports 
are both attractive and easy to interpret. 
 
In particular, the report layout considers essential elements such as report headers and footers, 
page headers and footers, column headings with proper alignment, and the grouping of detail 
lines to organize related information. These design principles allow reports to highlight important 
details while maintaining a consistent format across different sections. By following these 

--- PAGE 96 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 4 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 95 
guidelines, Qreclaim ensures that generated reports not only provide accurate data but also 
support effective decision-making by administrators and clear references for students. 
 
Figure 4.18 presents the on -demand claims report designed for Qreclaim, which demonstrates 
how these reporting principles are applied in practice.

4.6 User Interface (UI) Design 
The user interface (UI) design of Qreclaim provides a clear and user -friendly platform for 
students and administrators to interact with the system. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, 
ensuring that users can perform key tasks such as reporting lost i tems, submitting found items, 
and verifying claims without confusion. 
 
The interface uses consistent layouts, clear labels, and simple navigation to guide users through 
each process. Forms, buttons, and feedback messages are designed to be straightforward, helping 
users’ complete actions efficiently. The design also supports accessibility across different 
devices, including desktops, laptops, and kiosks. 
 
The following figures show the general layout and design of Qreclaim’s user interface.

4.7 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
This chapter detailed the system design of Qreclaim, translating the requirements gathered earlier 
into a comprehensive technical blueprint. In total, six designs were developed: software 
architecture design, process design, data design, security design, report design, and user interface 
design. Each of th ese was carefully planned to ensure that the system is functional, secure, 
scalable, and user-friendly. 
 
At the architectural level, Qreclaim adopts a layered three -tier design that separates the 
presentation, application, and data layers. This modular structure enhances scalability and 
maintainability while securing communication through a Flask RESTful API. The use of Firebase 
Firestore as the database allows real-time updates and reliable storage, while features such as AI-
based tagging, automated item matching, and notifications strengthen the efficiency of the lost -
and-found process. The design demonstrates foresight by incorporating features that can support 
future enhancements, such as mobile integration or expanded verification methods. 
 
The functional aspects of the system were expressed through case diagrams, activity diagrams, 
and detailed descriptions. These models clearly map how students and administrators will interact 
with the system, from reporting items to verifying claims using QR codes, RFID, and facial 
recognition. Together, they ensu re that the system addresses the full spectrum of user 
requirements. While comprehensive, these processes may also introduce a degree of complexity, 
particularly in the claim verification flow, which could require additional user guidance during 
deployment. 
 
The data design established a strong foundation by defining the entities, relationships, and 
attributes required for the system. The inclusion of an ERD, class diagram, and data dictionary 
ensures consistency and clarity in handling sensitive records such as student details, item reports, 
and claim information. The choice of a NoSQL database supports flexibility and scalability, 
though considerations around performance and operational costs will become important as the 
system grows. 
 
Security design was given significant attention, reflecting the sensitivity of the data being 
managed. Role -based access control, secure authentication, session management, input 
validation, and detailed logging were incorporated to protect against unautho rized access or 
misuse. The multi-layered verification process combining QR codes, RFID, and biometric checks 

--- PAGE 104 ---
Qreclaim Chapter 4 
 
 
BMCS3403 Project I 103 
offers a high degree of assurance in claim validation. Nonetheless, issues such as biometric data 
privacy, hardware reliability at kiosks, and compliance with data protection standards will require 
ongoing vigilance. 
 
The report design contributes to administrative oversight by providing clear, structured 
summaries of system activity, while the user interface design focuses on accessibility and ease 
of use. The interfaces for both students and administrators emphasize c larity, consistency, and 
intuitive navigation, ensuring that the system remains practical even for users with limited 
technical background. 
 
Overall, the system design of Qreclaim is thorough, well-structured, and aligned with its intended 
purpose. It demonstrates a balanced integration of functionality, security, and usability, offering 
clear improvements over traditional lost -and-found practices. Its modular architecture provides  
room for growth, while AI-driven features and multi-factor verification improve both efficiency 
and reliability. The main challenges lie in areas such as safeguarding biometric information, 
maintaining kiosk hardware, and ensuring smooth performance at sc ale. These are not 
weaknesses of the design itself but practical considerations for implementation. With careful 
attention to these aspects, Qreclaim has the potential to serve as a reliable and user -friendly 
solution for automating TAR UMT Johor’s lost-and-found process.
