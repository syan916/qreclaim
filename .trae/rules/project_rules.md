# Code Generation Standards(User Interface)
## General Code Generation Rules
1. Ensure the generated code follows responsive design principles and is suitable for mobile-first PWA (Progressive Web App) layouts
2. Avoid fixed-width layouts; use flexbox or CSS grid for responsive positioning
3. Always include the viewport meta tag for mobile optimization:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
